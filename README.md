This is a book recommendation system created as a project for my AD1 course. The application leverages data science techniques to provide personalized book suggestions to users.

The core of the project involves fetching book data, performing extensive data cleaning and preprocessing using Python libraries, and then implementing a recommendation algorithm to generate relevant suggestions.

Key Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests books based on user ratings and similarities.

Data-Driven: Utilizes Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.

Web Interface: A simple and clean user interface built with HTML and CSS to display recommendations.

Notebook-Powered Analysis: Initial data exploration and algorithm development were performed in Jupyter Notebooks.

Technology and Tools Used
Core Language: Python

Data Science Libraries: NumPy, Pandas

Frontend: HTML, CSS
